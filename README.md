# Personal-Finance-Tracker
This is a small web app that helps people keep track of their money. You can add your income (money you earn) and expenses (money you spend). The app will show you how much money you have left, what you spent on, and when you spent it.  It is built using HTML for the page layout, CSS for the design, and JavaScript to make everything work.
